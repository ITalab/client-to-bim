## 🫥 Introduction

BIM is central to AEC workflows, offering structured digital models of built assets. However, aligning unstructured text data such as specs, codes, and requirements with BIM elements remains a key challenge. NLP methods, especially transformer-based LMs, enable semantic mapping between text and BIM components. This work proposes a framework that integrates transformers with BIM to automate compliance, retrieval, and querying tasks across AEC domains.

## 📊 Dataset Overview (JSON Format)

Each entry in this dataset is organized by **class name** followed by a list of **text samples**. The structure is designed for easy parsing and use in NLP classification tasks.

### 🧾 Description

- **Keys**: Represent class labels (e.g., `OCR`, `OUU`, `OBC`).
- **Values**: Lists of string texts associated with that class.

## Download Model

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

file_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="ZappyKirby/client-to-bim", filename="model.safetensors")

```

or manually download weights from hugging face
